# Every number the simulation runs on, in one place.
#
# These are game-feel values, not physical ones -- gravity here is 2.4x Earth
# because a game about being launched off a bridge wants a fast, readable arc,
# not a floaty one. Where a value is doing something non-obvious it says so.
#
# Tuning happens HERE and nowhere else. A magic number in a step function is a
# number nobody will find when the feel is wrong.

# --- Tick ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The sim tick IS the physics tick. This is load-bearing, not a coincidence:
# CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide() takes its delta from the physics frame, so a
# reconciliation replay of N ticks inside a single frame only reproduces the
# original N frames if the tick and the physics step are the same duration.
# project.godot pins physics to 60 Hz; if that changes, this changes with it.

# --- Walking ------------------------------------------------------------------
const WALK_SPEED := 6.0
const WALK_ACCEL := 60.0      # reaches full speed in 0.1s -- responsive, not floaty
const WALK_FRICTION := 50.0   # stops in 0.12s, so releasing input reads as a stop
const GRAVITY := 24.0
const JUMP_VELOCITY := 8.0    # ~1.33 m apex, ~0.67 s airtime under the gravity above

# --- Input action bits --------------------------------------------------------
# One tick's actions travel as a single int. Edge-triggered actions (jump, and
# later shove/rope) are set for exactly the tick they were pressed, which is what
# preserves "just pressed" semantics through a reconciliation replay.

# --- Networking ---------------------------------------------------------------
# How far the client's prediction may drift from the host's authoritative frame
# before we rewind and replay. Too small and the client replays constantly for no
# visible benefit; too large and players see themselves in the wrong place.

# Every input packet repeats the last few inputs. Input goes over an unreliable
# channel, and a dropped packet carrying an edge-triggered action bit is a jump
# (later: a shove) that the player pressed and the game never performed. Repeats
# make that need three consecutive losses instead of one.

# Ticks between authoritative snapshots. 1 = every tick, which is correct and
# wasteful; the design doc flags the real rate as open, to be decided against a
# measurement rather than a guess. Correctness first, bandwidth later.
